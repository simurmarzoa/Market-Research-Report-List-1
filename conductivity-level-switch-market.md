<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conductivity Level Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Electrode</li><li>Suspended Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the conductivity level switch market, there are two primary types: solid electrode and suspended electrode switches. Solid electrode switches utilize fixed probes that directly contact the liquid to measure conductivity and determine the level. They are often used in clear liquids. Suspended electrode switches, on the other hand, have probes submerged in the liquid without relying on fixed positioning, allowing them to detect varying levels in a broader range of conditions, including viscous or contaminated fluids.</p></p>
