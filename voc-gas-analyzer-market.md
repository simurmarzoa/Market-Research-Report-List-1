<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Gas Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC gas analyzer market primarily features two types: Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors. PID analyzers utilize ultraviolet light to ionize volatile organic compounds, offering rapid, sensitive detection across a wide range of compounds. In contrast, MOS sensors function by measuring changes in resistance when gases interact with a metal-oxide surface, providing cost-effective solutions for detecting specific VOC levels. Both technologies play crucial roles in environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and indoor air quality assessments.</p></p>
